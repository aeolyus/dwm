## Requirements
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


## Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):
``` sh
make clean install
```

##Running dwm
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:
``` sh
exec dwm
```
In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:
``` sh
DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm
```
(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:
``` sh
while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
do
	sleep 1
done &
exec dwm
```

## Configuration
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
